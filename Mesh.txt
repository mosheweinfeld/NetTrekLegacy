Mesh Server:
Master server puts players in a synchronized game.
Players share distrubuted workload and network to confirm
that each client is standard.

Baton anticipation(tm):
	When a client creates an object, the object will be created and hosted on another client.
	Both clients are aware of eachother and expect limited behaviour. Abnormal behaviours or requests
	are logged on each other's clients and submitted to the master server for confirmation.

NearbyOwnership:
	Object "ownership" is passed to the nearest Player to that object.
	Clients should verify against one another

Sector Communion:
	The map is divided into even fields, each assigned to one player to process.
	The player shares an adjacent field with another player and verify against eachother.
